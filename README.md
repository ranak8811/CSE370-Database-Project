# Simple Task Management Project for CSE370 Database Course

This is a basic Django project developed for the CSE370 Database course. In this project, users must sign in to access the task management system. Once logged in, users can add tasks with different priority levels, such as **weekly** or **monthly**. 

### Features:
- **Task Management:** Completed tasks will be displayed in the "Completed" section, while incomplete tasks will remain in their respective weekly or monthly categories.
- **All Tasks View:** Every task, regardless of its status, will appear in the "All Tasks" section.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for tasks using the built-in search feature.
- **User Authentication:** Users can sign out at any time and log back in when needed.

This project was developed by a team of five members, including myself. While it provides a basic structure for task management, there is still significant room for improvement to enhance its functionality. 

This project serves as a showcase of our work for the course. Any feedback or suggestions for improvement are welcome. Thank you!
